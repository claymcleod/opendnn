This repository is simply a toy deep neural network library I 
am writing to learning more about the intricacies that go into
layer design and development in Theano. It will be used as a
testing ground for my ideas involving DNNs.

For papers that influenced this library, please visit the 'Papers'
folder.

For my notes I've deemed important through this process, please
visit the "Notes" folder.
